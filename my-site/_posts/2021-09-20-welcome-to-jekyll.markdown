Hacktoberfest is near and Women Who Code wants to help it's members contribute this year. Learn how to do so..



Open Source Contributions are a great way for beginners to wet their feet into the world of coding. 
OSS is all around us, from Linux systems we use everyday to the tools we use for code development. 
Contributing to OSS is a great way to be a part of an ecosystem which nutures growth and helps you be a part of a bigger picture. 

Open Source can be a way to hone your skills, share them and also gain a deeper understanding of the stack. On top of that, it can help build your portfolio and build your career. Last but not the least, it is fun and gives you the satisfaction of achieveing something great.

If we have got you excited, let us check how to contribute to open source:

1. Blogs or Tutorials: If you are using a software tool or package, share your best practices or maybe even a fun example with the community. Another way to contribute, is to transalate projects/blogs to your native language. It will help a lot of other folks break into tech.

2. Be a Mentor or Answer Questions: If you love to explain things and want to give back to the community, mentorship is a great place to start. You can be a mentor to someone contributing for the first time during [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). We are always looking for mentors, click [here](https://forms.gle/hP8WzDH4KKHsz1S87). You can also answer questions on Stackoverflow or other platforms. 

3. Contribute to a Github Repository: There are various ways to target a Github Repo. You can change the decription of the project, add example to show how the code works or even see if the code needs changes/improvement. Hacktoberfest(https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/resources) is a great place to start and that is why in this month, we will be helping you with resources and mentors to make a head start into your first contribution!
